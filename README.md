# Python CLI Password Manager

This is a Python command-line interface (CLI) password manager project. It allows you to generate strong random passwords, create profiles to store multiple passwords with their associated website or login parameters, and encrypt the credentials using a master password for added security.

## Features

-   Generate Random Strong Passwords: Easily generate long strong and secure passwords containing uppercase, lowercase characters and special characters
    
-   Create Password Profiles: Organize your passwords by creating profiles to store multiple passwords. Each profile can include the website or login parameters associated with the password.
    
-   Encryption with Master Password: Encrypt the credentials in database using a master password to ensure the security and confidentiality of your stored credentials.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/MohandZaid/Password-Manager.git`

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
`cd password-manager`

3.  Install the required dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage

1.  Run the password manager:
`python3 run.py`

2.  Follow the prompts help message to perform the desired actions, such as generating a password, creating profiles, or accessing existing passwords.

## Future To-Do

-   Cloud Backup: Implement functionality to save encrypted password databases as a backup in cloud storage applications like Google Drive.
    
-   GUI Version: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) version of the password manager for a more user-friendly experience.

-  CLI support: Develop a set of commands, options, or arguments that allow users to interact with the password manager program without opening the prompt. This will enable users to perform various actions such as generating passwords, creating profiles, and managing their encrypted credentials directly from the command line. This CLI support will enhance the usability and automation capabilities of the password manager.
